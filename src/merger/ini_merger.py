    keys collide by coincidence: ``Stanton2`` (the Crusader planet's name
    key) and ``Stanton_2`` (a different key, the star, holding "Stanton
    (Star)") both canonicalize to "stanton2". The longest-value tie-break
    then overwrote the planet's name with the star's. An audit of a real
    base.ini found 14 more live collisions of this shape (comm-array
    button text, a mission title, ship-interior area names, Options-menu
    turret labels, two different thruster names merged into one, …) —
    this was silently corrupting shipped content anywhere in the table,
