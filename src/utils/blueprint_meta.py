"""Per-blueprint-item metadata for the Blueprints shuttle filters (#157 follow-up).

The Blueprints ownership section lets users filter the blueprint catalogue by
the mission it drops from and by ship-component attributes (type / class /
size / grade). Those attributes are not reliably on a mission's blueprint
bullets: the ``[CLASS-Sx-grade]`` tag only appears inline when the "annotate
components in mission descriptions" toggle is on. The robust source is each
component's own ``item_Name*`` entry, which stays tagged whenever the
components enhancement is generated and whose loc key encodes the component
type (QDRV / SHLD / COOL / RADR / ...). We join the blueprint bullet display
names to those component entries by normalized name (an exact match after the
leading tag is stripped).

Mission names come from pairing each blueprint-bearing ``..._Desc_NNN`` entry
with its sibling ``..._Title_NNN`` entry.

Qt-free so it unit-tests with plain entry stand-ins (anything exposing
``key`` / ``original_value`` / ``category``).

# are keyed by piece (backpack / undersuit / ...) with no "armor" token, so
# without these they fell into the "Other" type bucket (#195). "_core" (with
# the leading underscore) covers the torso-platform piece of newer
# manufacturer-prefixed FPS armor sets (e.g.
# item_Name_qrt_specialist_heavy_core_01_01_01 -> "Antium Core",
# item_Name_kap_combat_light_core_01_01_01 -> "Geist Armor Core") whose keys
# carry no "armor" token either — CIG's older sets do (cds_armor_heavy_core_*),
# so this was inconsistent rather than universally missing. Every armor key
# this targets carries the underscore form (..._core_01_...), so "_core"
# matches everything the bare word would while ruling out "score"-shaped
# collisions (bare "core" is a substring of "score") and any future CamelCase
# component name ("SomethingCore") whose prefix code isn't in the component
# map yet — same underscore-guard shape already used for "_legs"/"_arms".
# Ship components sharing the "core" word (LuxCore, CoolCore, ThermalCore)
# were never actually at risk either way: they carry a component-type-code
# prefix (POWR_/COOL_) resolved earlier by component_type_from_key, which
# always wins first.

# "gys_jacket" / "gys_pants" cover the Carnifex set's torso/leg pieces
# (item_Name_gys_jacket_01_01_01 -> "Carnifex Armor Core",
# item_Name_gys_pants_01_01_01 -> "Carnifex Armor Legs") — yet another
# manufacturer-specific naming scheme with no "armor" token. Scoped to the
# "gys_" prefix rather than bare "jacket"/"pants": those bare words match
# hundreds of unrelated civilian wardrobe items (987/ALB/CTL/DMC fashion
