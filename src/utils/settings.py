    # Rebrand moved the product name from "SC Localization Editor" to
    # "Smart Citizen" in 0.9.0. The Documents folder got renamed back then
    # (see migrate_docs_folder_rename). The registry node was left alone
    # to preserve existing users' settings, which meant fresh-eyes readers
    # kept seeing the old name under HKCU. The helpers below perform a
    # one-shot copy from the legacy node to the new node, then delete the
    # old subtree. A marker value (_MIGRATION_MARKER) short-circuits
    # subsequent runs so this is cheap on every startup.

        so every subsequent launch no-ops cheaply.

        **Registry side:** if ``GAME_INSTALL_PATH`` is set but ``SC_INSTALL_ROOT``

        record the parent as ``SC_INSTALL_ROOT``. ``ACTIVE_CHANNEL`` is set

        recognizable channel suffix — matches pre-0.9.3 behavior).

        old flat layout (``base.ini`` / ``cache\`` / ``backups\`` / ``user.ini``)
        and no ``LIVE\`` (or other channel) subfolder exists, move those

        resolving channel-scoped. Skips anything that looks like a channel
        directory, the migration marker, and the registry mirror files,
        leaving unrelated files untouched.

        Failures during the filesystem move are logged but not raised — the
