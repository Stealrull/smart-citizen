"""Export/import owned blueprints as JSON or CSV.

Qt-free (file dialogs and QMessageBox summaries live in
blueprint_tracker_tab.py) so the format handling and name-matching logic can
be unit-tested directly.

The JSON shape structurally matches SCMDB's own export (version / exportedAt
/ missions / blueprints[]) for compatibility with tools that already read
that format, but Smart Citizen has no real value for SCMDB's per-item "tag"
/ "url" fields (those are SCMDB's own item identifiers), so they're omitted
rather than faked. "missions" stays an empty list -- Smart Citizen tracks
blueprint ownership, not mission completion, so there's nothing real to put
there either.

    *imported* is already normalized (parse_import_names runs every name
    through normalize_item_name). *known* -- the Blueprint Tracker's own
    dict keys -- is not, so this normalizes a working copy of *known* here
    rather than assuming the caller already did (a bare set intersection
    would silently break normalize_item_name's own documented invariant:
    "both sides... so the folding is symmetric and can never introduce a
    one-sided mismatch"). Currently a no-op for every real blueprint name
    in the data (none contain brackets, tags, or annotations that
    normalize_item_name would strip), but the asymmetry is real and cheap
    to close, so there's no reason to leave it latent.

    *matched* returns *known*'s original (unnormalized) names, not the
    normalized form used for comparison -- callers persist these into the
    Owned set, which must stay keyed exactly as the Blueprint Tracker's own
    dict, or a subsequent blueprint_meta.get(name) lookup (e.g. in export)
    would silently miss.

    ``enclosings`` is forwarded to ``normalize_item_name`` (#352), same
    default as :func:`parse_import_names`.

    ``catalogue``, when given, is every real item name this install
    currently knows about (see ``blueprint_meta.known_item_names``) -- used
    to recover a foreign-editor-decorated import name (#372) the same way a
    log scan or ``MainWindow._repair_foreign_owned_names`` would, e.g. an
    exported owned set from before upgrading that still reads
    ``"Ind/1/B Colossus"``. A name only counts as recovered when it resolves
    into something *known* actually has right now -- if the resolved real
    name isn't currently Blueprint-Tracker-eligible either (rotated out of
    every mission's reward pool, say), there is nothing to mark it owned
    against, so it correctly stays unmatched rather than being force-fit.
    Omitting ``catalogue`` skips recovery entirely (the original behavior).
