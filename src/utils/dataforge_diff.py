dataforge_diff.py — Diff-cache for the DataForge XML cache.

Usage
-----
After unforge writes the cache, call `update_manifest` to snapshot it.
Before running enhancement generators, call `dirty_categories` to find
out which ones actually need to re-run.

    from utils.dataforge_diff import update_manifest, dirty_categories

    # In EnhancementsGeneratorWorker / pak_extractor, after extraction:
    update_manifest(cache_dir)

    # Before each generator run:
    dirty = dirty_categories(cache_dir)
    # dirty == None  →  no prior manifest; run everything
    # dirty == set() →  nothing changed; skip everything
    # dirty == {"ships", "missions"} →  only re-run those two
