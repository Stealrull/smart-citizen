"""Owned-blueprint tagging (#157).

Users mark blueprint items they already own; an ``[Owned]`` tag is then woven
onto that item wherever it appears in a mission reward POTENTIAL BLUEPRINTS
list. Keyed by item *display name* (issue #157 option a) because the GUI table
never sees item UUIDs — it works purely from localization keys and values.

Qt-free and settings-free so it can be unit-tested with plain strings: the
Tag Builder's enclosing style is per-category, user-configurable, live
QSettings state, so it's never read here directly. Callers who need
non-default-enclosing matching (#352) resolve the user's live Tag Builder
config themselves (see ``enclosings_from_tag_configs`` below, which is the
one place this module references ``tag_builder``'s plain data tables — not
settings) and hand this module a plain ``enclosings`` tuple. The transform is
idempotent: it strips any existing ``[Owned]`` tags before re-applying, so it
can run on every load and on every toggle without doubling.

Values use a literal ``\\n`` (backslash-n) line separator — the in-INI encoding
the parser and game both read — so all matching here is on the two-character
sequence, not a real newline.

    conservative fallback (:func:`_looks_like_none_style_tag_word`) tries to
    strip a "None (space only)"-shaped leading/trailing word -- best-effort,
    since there's no delimiter and no known value to confirm it against.

    The alias fold runs last, after the tag/annotation strips, so a decorated
    bullet (``[Mining Laser-S0] Hofstede``) reduces to the bare name first and
    then resolves like any other.

    Both sides of every comparison pass through here (the owned-set entries and
    the mission bullets in ``apply_owned_to_value``), so the folding is
    symmetric and can never introduce a one-sided mismatch. The category-
    annotation strip is safe on both sides even though it's bullet-specific:
    the allow-listed words never appear as a real item_Name's own trailing
    parenthetical, so it's a no-op wherever it doesn't apply.

    """Recover the real item a foreign-formatted *name* refers to, or None.

    Star Citizen writes whatever name it was DISPLAYING into Game.log, so a
    player who previously ran another localization editor has that tool's
    naming permanently baked into their old logs. Smart Citizen then scans
    those logs and stores names it can never match against its own item list.
    Reported in #372: a user who had run StarStrings had owned entries reading
    ``Ind/1/B Colossus`` while every other side of the app called the same item
    ``Colossus``, so their blueprints never showed as owned. Deleting and
    regenerating did not help, because the bad names are in the LOGS, not in
    anything Smart Citizen writes.

    Deliberately not a pattern-match against any particular tool's format.
    Matching ``Ind/1/B`` would fix StarStrings and nothing else, and would need
    extending for every editor anyone has ever used. Instead this anchors on
    the one thing we know is true: *catalogue* is the set of real, normalized
    item names built from the current localization data. If a scanned name ends
    in a known real item name, on a word boundary, that is what it refers to,
    whatever decoration precedes it. That works for any tool, including ones
    that do not exist yet.

    Suffix rather than prefix because these tools prepend their tag and leave
    the real name at the end -- StarStrings does, and so does Smart Citizen's
    own default placement.

    Returns None when nothing in *catalogue* is a matching suffix. The longest
    match wins when more than one catalogue entry qualifies, so
    ``Mil/1/B Fierell Cascade`` resolves to ``Fierell Cascade`` and not to the
    equally-real but shorter ``Cascade`` -- two catalogue entries can never
    tie at the same length, since a fixed-length trailing slice of *n* has
    exactly one possible value, so at most one member of a set can equal it.

    Callers pass names that already failed a direct catalogue lookup, so this
    only ever runs on strings that are otherwise unusable. *catalogue* should
    be every real item name this install currently knows about (see
    ``blueprint_meta.known_item_names``), not a narrower "eligible right now"
    subset -- a name absent from *catalogue* only because it means "not a
    known real item", never "known but temporarily unlisted", or a real
    owned item can resolve into an unrelated shorter one and be lost. See
    ``repair_foreign_owned_names``'s docstring for the incident this caused.
