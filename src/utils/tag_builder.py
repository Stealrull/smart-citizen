"""Dynamic tag builder for enhancement name annotations.

Used by both the enhancement generator (CLI / worker thread) and the
Enhancements tab live preview, so it must be pure Python with no Qt
dependency. A `TagConfig` describes one category's tag (element order,
per-element style, separator, enclosing brackets, and the class-variant
mapping when applicable); `render_tag()` produces the final bracketed
string given that config plus a values dict.

Defaults in DEFAULT_TAG_CONFIGS are calibrated to match the previously
hardcoded format strings byte-for-byte so an existing user sees no
change in their generated INIs until they edit a config.
