    A plain QScrollArea is the wrong shape for this job: it reports a
    generic 576x384 sizeHint regardless of content and defaults to an
    Expanding vertical policy, so wrapping the String Editor's filter row
    in one made it 358px tall for a 44px row (measured) — a large empty
    background with the controls floating in the middle — and stole that
    height from the table below. It also left the layout free to squeeze
    the row below its natural width, clipping the trailing buttons behind
    a scrollbar even on a wide screen.

    This reports the wrapped row's own hints instead:

    * height — the row's natural height (plus a reserved strip for the
      horizontal scrollbar), floored at ``matched_height`` so the box can
      be lined up with a neighbour of a known height. Fixed vertical
      policy makes the layout honour it exactly.
    * width  — the row's natural width as the *preferred* size, so a
      layout with room to spare gives the row everything it needs.
    * minimum width — near zero, which is the whole point of the wrapper:
      the row's ~1300px natural width would otherwise propagate up
      through the outer QScrollArea (see setup_ui) and force the whole
      window wider than a narrow screen. Shrinking scrolls this row
      internally instead, the same way the table already contains its own
      column overflow.

    The wrapped row is pinned to the *box* height and anchored to the top
    of the viewport. Pinning is what keeps the controls still: with
    ``setWidgetResizable(True)`` alone the row tracks the viewport, and the
    viewport loses ~12px the moment the horizontal scrollbar appears, so
    the row's vertically centred controls jumped ~6px and fell out of
    alignment with the preview pane exactly as the window crossed that
    width. Pinning to the box height (rather than the row's own natural
    height) also means the row's own layout centres the controls in the
    full box, which is what lines them up with the pane beside them.
