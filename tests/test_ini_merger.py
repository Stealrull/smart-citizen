"""Tests for src/merger/ini_merger.py — sync_key_variants and the
merge_sources_by_hierarchy pipeline that drives it.

sync_key_variants had no test coverage at all before this file, despite two
real bug reports against its variant-selection heuristic (a naive "first
variant wins" pass, then a "prefer non-_SCItem" pre-filter, both wrong in
opposite ways — see the docstring in ini_merger.py). These tests pin the
three real-data shapes that broke it, plus the guard added so a user's
override to a variant can't be silently outvoted by the longest-value rule.

TestSyncKeyVariantsDomainScope (#257) pins a third, more severe bug: the
canonical-key grouping used to run over EVERY key in the merged table, not
just item_Name*/item_Desc*. Two completely unrelated CIG loc keys —
Stanton2 (the Crusader planet) and Stanton_2 (the Stanton star) — collapsed
to the same canonical string purely because underscore-stripping ignores
what the underscore was actually separating, and the star's longer value
overwrote the planet's name on the in-game starmap. A real base.ini audit
found 14 total live corruptions of this shape. The fix scopes the sync to
item_Name*/item_Desc* keys only; these tests lock that boundary down so it
can never again silently expand to swallow unrelated content.
