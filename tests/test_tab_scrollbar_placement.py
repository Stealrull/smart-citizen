"""Every tab's scrollbars must sit in the same place.

This is the contract the whole change exists to deliver, and it had no test.
It is produced by declarative settings scattered across five builders
(create_strings_tab, create_about_tab, create_faq_tab, create_legal_tab and
LogTab.setup_ui) plus the two status labels being moved above their views, so
reverting any one of them reinstates the misalignment with nothing failing.

The faults being locked out, both reported from the real app:

* The String Editor was the only content tab with no scroll area of its own,
  so its overflow fell through to the window-level scroll area, which renders
  below the tab widget. Measured 70px away from where Config and Enhancements
  put theirs, and outside the tab area entirely.
* A widget below a view stops that view's horizontal bar reaching the tab's
  bottom edge, which left the Log tab 24px out of line.

Deliberately excluded from the comparison:

* ``SingleRowScrollArea`` (the String Editor's filter strip) owns a bar
  *inside* its own 60px box by design, so it is not a tab-level bar.
* The outer content scroll area is the window's last-resort chrome scroller;
  a separate test asserts it stays out of the way entirely.
