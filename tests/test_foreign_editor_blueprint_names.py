"""Blueprint names left behind by another localization editor (#372).

Star Citizen writes whatever item name it was DISPLAYING into Game.log. A
player who previously ran a different localization editor therefore has that
tool's naming permanently baked into their old logs, and Smart Citizen's log
scan imports it verbatim into the owned set. Those names match nothing on the
mission side, so the blueprints never show as owned.

The reporter had run StarStrings. Their owned set read ``Ind/1/B Colossus``
while every other part of the app called the same item ``Colossus``. Deleting
every Smart Citizen folder and reinstalling did not help, because the bad names
live in the logs rather than in anything Smart Citizen writes, so each re-scan
reintroduced them.

The fix deliberately does not pattern-match StarStrings. Matching ``Ind/1/B``
would fix exactly one tool and need extending for every other editor anyone has
used. It anchors on the real item catalogue instead: if a scanned name ends in
a known real item name on a word boundary, that is the item, whatever
decoration precedes it.

Samples below are the real strings from the reporter's uploaded Game.log and
from tests/fixtures/kraken_global_latest.ini, which is itself a StarStrings-
modified global.ini (451 of its component names carry that tool's tags).
