"""Static coverage guard for the #247 i18n sweep.

Scans every ``src/gui/*.py`` file for ``tr("some.key")`` call sites and
asserts each key actually resolves against ``languages/english/ui.json`` —
present, and not an empty leaf that would silently fall back to the bare
key string. Catches the exact class of bug #247 was filed over: a literal
that looks translated (wrapped in ``tr()``) but whose key was never added
to the English base, so it renders as the raw dotted key instead of text.

Purely static (regex + JSON, no Qt import), so it runs without pytest-qt
and isn't subject to the GUI-code test exemption — there's no widget to
instantiate here, just a source/data consistency check.
