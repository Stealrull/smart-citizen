"""The branding labels must never absorb spare vertical height.

A QLabel defaults to a Preferred vertical policy, which lets it grow. In
Simple mode the view stack is capped (so the hidden Advanced page can't
reserve height nothing is using), which means the stack cannot take spare
height itself. Qt then handed it to whatever else could grow, and that was
these two labels: measured on a maximised window, the title and tagline each
ballooned from their 35px and 15px hints to 343px, leaving the title stranded
at the top with a few hundred pixels of nothing before the tagline.

The fix is a Fixed vertical policy on both. It is one declarative line in
setup_ui, so without this test a regression that dropped it would reinstate
the reported bug with the whole rest of the suite still green.

This is the only test that builds a real MainWindow. It is worth the cost
here because the bug is a property of the assembled window: the stub used
elsewhere in tests/test_ui_mode.py has no branding labels and no content
layout to distribute height through, so it cannot observe this at all.
Settings, user-data and cache directories are all redirected to tmp_path so
the construction touches nothing real.
