"""unforge timing out must say so, and say what to do about it (#370).

A user's DataForge extraction died after exactly 1800 seconds and all the app
told them was "DataForge extraction failed". The traceback ended in
subprocess._communicate with no exception type, their log carried nothing from
unforge, and they spent the next stretch chasing a memory reading that turned
out to be a symptom.

The cause was a Data.p4k that did not match its own build_manifest.id: a
114 MB Game.dcb where a healthy install of the identical build (verified
byte-for-byte on BuildId) carries a 330 MB Game2.dcb. Measured, that healthy
file converts in about 40 seconds against a 1800 second budget, so a timeout
here is a mismatched install rather than a slow machine, and the fix is Verify
Files in the RSI launcher.

Three things have to hold for the next person to get that without a
maintainer reading their log:

* the timeout is caught and turned into DataForgeTimeoutError, which the
  worker recognises the way it already recognises P4kLockedError;
* the message names the database and its size, because "Game.dcb (114 MB)"
  versus "Game2.dcb (330 MB)" is the entire diagnosis;
* unforge's partial output, which subprocess.run attaches to the exception on
  Windows and the old code discarded, reaches the log.
