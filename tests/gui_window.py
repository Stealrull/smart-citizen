"""Safe construction of a real ``MainWindow`` for tests.

Most GUI tests here drive a small widget, or the real unbound method against a
lightweight stub (see tests/test_ui_mode.py). A couple of properties can only
be observed on the fully assembled window, though, and building one in-process
turned out to have three separate ways of taking the whole pytest run down.
Each was found by hitting it, so they live here rather than being rediscovered
by whoever writes the third such file:

* ``showEvent`` kicks off the real startup work, including the
  ``AppUpdateCheckWorker`` network thread. That raced teardown and killed the
  process with a heap corruption (0xc0000374, faulthandler naming the thread).
  ``_maybe_start_first_run_tutorial`` is stubbed out to prevent it.
* ``MainWindow`` installs an error-dialog handler on the ROOT logger, which
  outlives the window. A later log record fires a Qt signal at it, and an
  ERROR record tries to open a modal dialog with nobody to dismiss it, hanging
  the session at exit. It has to be detached on the way out.
* Destroying a ``MainWindow`` mid-session is unsafe full stop. It owns timers,
  a model and a child tree Qt goes on touching, and ``close()`` +
  ``deleteLater()`` crashed roughly 1 run in 4 with an access violation;
  draining ``DeferredDelete`` explicitly made it 3 in 6. Windows are hidden
  and kept alive for the process instead, held in ``_LIVE_WINDOWS`` so
  Python's garbage collector can't delete the C++ object by the back door.

Settings, user-data and cache directories are all redirected into the caller's
tmp path, so construction touches nothing real.

Prefer the stub in tests/test_ui_mode.py where it can observe what you need;
reach for this only when the behaviour is a property of the whole window.

    a bare ``pytest.MonkeyPatch()`` with ``undo()`` called after a ``yield``:
