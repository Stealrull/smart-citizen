"""MainWindow._repair_foreign_owned_names: settings wiring + defensiveness.

The actual recovery decision (repair_foreign_owned_names in owned_items.py)
is Qt-free/settings-free and tested directly in
tests/test_foreign_editor_blueprint_names.py. This file covers only what that
pure function can't: the MainWindow method's own two responsibilities --
reading/writing AppSettings.owned_items correctly around it, and never
letting a failure inside the repair step escape as an exception, since it
runs unconditionally from _rebuild_blueprint_metadata on every load and a
load that already succeeded must not get reported as failed over an
ancillary cleanup step breaking (review follow-up on #372/PR #375).

Driven on a lightweight stand-in ``self`` (the real unbound method), not a
constructed MainWindow -- same reasoning and pattern as tests/test_ui_mode.py:
building the whole window pulls in the full startup pipeline and there's no
pytest-qt in dev deps to drive it safely.
