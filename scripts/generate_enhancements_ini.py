generate_enhancements_ini.py
────────────────────────────
Generates enhancement-augmented INI files for use as additional sources in
SC Localization Editor.

All enhancements are sourced directly from the game's DataForge entity XML files
(extracted from Data.p4k via unp4k + unforge).  No external JSON sources.

Output files (written to OUTPUT_DIR / cache):
  ships_desc_enhancements.ini             – vehicle_Desc* entries with flight/specs data
  components_desc_enhancements.ini        – item_Desc* COOL/SHLD/POWR/QDRV with numerical data
  ship_weapons_desc_enhancements.ini      – item_Desc* ship weapon data
  fps_weapons_desc_enhancements.ini       – item_Desc* FPS weapon data
  medical_consumables_enhancements.ini    – item_Desc* CureLife pens; static curated
                                             effect text, not DataForge-derived (the
                                             stock descriptions are lore-only and never

# ── Derived-lookup disk cache ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Walking the DataForge tree is expensive (~85s for scitem alone). These
# lookups are pure functions of the DataForge cache contents, so we pickle
# them under cache/dataforge/.lookups/ keyed on the .p4k_mtime stamp written
# by pak_extractor.py. When DataForge is re-extracted, the stamp changes and
# the cache is invalidated automatically.

# Per-cache builder version. Bump the value whenever the builder for that
# cache changes its WHAT-it-collects semantics (new source dirs, schema
# additions, etc.) so existing pickled results from before the change get
# detected as stale and rebuilt — the .p4k_mtime fingerprint alone can't
# catch this because the underlying DataForge data hasn't changed, only
# our parsing of it has.
#
# History:
#   blueprint_pools v2 (1.3.1) — walks all crafting/blueprintrewards/
#     subdirs (was: only blueprintmissionpools/). Adds ~40 new pool
#     records that 4.8 PTU references via 48blueprints/ + a new
#     xenothreat2rewards/ dir.
#   blueprint_pools v3 (1.3.1) — fallback name from blueprint XML
#     filename when the entityClass UUID isn't __ref'd anywhere in
#     the cache (PTU WIP state — blueprints shipped ahead of their
#     entity records, e.g. fuel-nozzle blueprints in 4.8). Without
#     this the pool's names list ended up empty and the entire pool
#     was dropped, swallowing the [BP?] tag for those missions.
#   blueprint_pools v4 (1.3.1) — second-tier filename-stem fallback
#     (entity_names_by_filename) before falling through to the ugly
#     filename-derived placeholder. Recovers real localized names
#     ("Norfield", "Harkin", "RN-7s") for fuel-nozzle blueprints
#     whose entityClass UUIDs are CIG-WIP-broken — the entity XML
#     itself ships in entities/scitem/ with the matching stem and
#     a clean Localization Name attribute, we just couldn't reach
#     it via UUID. v3 produced "Nozzle Fuelgiver Grin Nozzlefast";
#     v4 produces "Norfield".
#   scitem_lookups v2 (1.3.1) — return tuple shape changed from
#     (mag_lookup, entity_names) to (mag_lookup, entity_names,
#     entity_names_by_filename) to feed the v4 blueprint_pools
#     filename-stem fallback. v1 pickles will fail to unpack into
#     the new 3-tuple, so we MUST invalidate them.
#   scitem_lookups v3 (1.4.0) — added a fourth tuple slot
#     (entity_name_tags: ref → "[CLASS-Sx-grade]") so blueprint pool
#     items get the same annotation components do in their stock title.
#     v2 pickles unpack as 3-tuples and would crash on the new 4-tuple
#     consumer, so bump invalidates them.
#   blueprint_pools v5 (1.4.0) — pool item names now carry the inline
#     [CLASS-Sx-grade] tag when the underlying entity is a tagged
#     component (shield/cooler/powerplant/qdrive/radar). Old v4 pickles
#     stored the un-annotated strings, so reusing them would silently
#     undo the new annotation on cache hit.
#   blueprint_pools v6 (1.4.0) — strip the leading CIG-baked size prefix
#     (``S0 ``, ``S00 ``, ``S1 ``…) from blueprint-list display names
#     so mining-head entries like "S0 Helix" render as "Helix" alongside
#     tagger-classified items, instead of carrying a second size
#     convention CIG embedded in the loc-name attribute. v5 pickles
#     hold the un-stripped names, so reusing them would defeat the strip.
#   scitem_lookups v4 / blueprint_pools v7 (1.4.0) — _component_name_tag
#     gained a fallback path that tags items lacking the full
#     Size:/Grade:/Class: trio, using Item Type: as a Class: substitute
#     and emitting partial shapes like [MIN-S0-B] (Helix) or [MIN-S0]
#     (Arbor MHV). Both lookups stored values produced by the strict-only
#     tagger and would silently keep mining heads / lasers untagged on
#     cache hit, so both invalidate together.
#   blueprint_pools v8 (1.4.0) — return tuple shape changed from
#     ``dict[uuid, items]`` to ``(dict[uuid, items], dict[uuid, name])``
#     so downstream rendering can derive rank-tier labels (Rank 0–1,
#     Rank 2–3, Rank 4) from the pool filename and emit them in the
#     POTENTIAL BLUEPRINTS sub-section headers. v7 pickles unpack as
#     a bare dict and crash the new 2-tuple consumer, so bump invalidates.
#   scitem_lookups v5 / blueprint_pools v9 (1.4.0) — ``build_scitem_lookups``
#     now honours the user's components ``TagConfig`` when rendering the
#     ``[CLASS-Sx-grade]`` entries that get baked onto mission POTENTIAL
#     BLUEPRINTS names. Pre-fix the tag was always rendered with the
#     DEFAULTS, so a user who set the Tag Builder to "Long (Military)" /
#     enclosing "Round" / etc. saw their components pipeline emit the new
#     style but mission descriptions still emitted ``[MIL-S3-B]``. The
#     cache key now folds in a hash of the components config (via
#     _cached_lookup's extra_key); both caches invalidate when the user
#     edits their config so the next run rebuilds with the new style.
#   scitem_lookups v6 / blueprint_pools v10 (2.0.0) — FPS weapons no longer
#     get a [CLASS-Sx-grade] tag: _component_name_tag was matching their
#     size/grade data by accident, surfacing nonsense tags like "[S30-A]
#     Rifle" in blueprint lists. build_scitem_lookups now skips anything
#     under fps_weapons. Separately, the CIG size-prefix strip is bounded
#     (<= _MAX_CIG_SIZE) so a real product name like "S71 Rifle" keeps its
#     "S71" instead of being mangled to "Rifle". Both lookups carry the
#     affected names, so both bump to force a rebuild.
#   scitem_lookups v7 / blueprint_pools v11 / standings v2 (2.0.0) —
#     per-language enhancement generation (#30) made the generation loc
#     language-dependent, but these caches key only on DataForge build:
#     a French-first build would bake French names/standings into the
#     pickle and the next English run would silently reuse them. The
#     builders now always consume the ENGLISH base.ini loc (annotations
#     deliberately stay English under #30 option A), making the cached
#     values language-independent again. Bump flushes any pickle built
#     from a non-English loc before this fix.
#   scitem_lookups v8 / blueprint_pools v12 (2.1.0, #160) — typeless component
#     tags ("[S1-A]" — size+grade, no class) are no longer woven into
#     blueprint lists. Armour, magazines and salvage/mining heads expose
#     Size/Grade but no ship-component class, so they were picking up a
#     meaningless "[S1-A]" in POTENTIAL BLUEPRINTS. entity_name_tags now keeps
#     only CLASS/TYPE-qualified tags; both lookups carry the affected names so
#     both bump to force a rebuild.
#   standings v3 (#239 review follow-up) — _build_standings now returns a
#     (rank_lookup, track_lookup) 2-tuple instead of a bare rank dict, folding
#     in the former standalone standing_tracks job so the standings XMLs are
#     only walked once. v2 pickles unpack as a bare dict and crash the new
#     2-tuple consumer, so bump invalidates.
#   scitem_lookups v9 (2.3.0, #266) — build_scitem_lookups now emits
#     fuel-nozzle and mining-laser entries into entity_name_tags (the new
#     bare-type tagging). A v8 pickle predates those entries (or, for
#     pre-scope-cut tester builds, carries retired [SCM] scraper tags), so
#     an unchanged-DataForge regen would weave mission bullets from stale
#     tags: mining lasers have no loc-derived name_fallback_tags rescue, so
#     without this bump their bullets silently stay untagged.
#   scitem_lookups v10 / blueprint_pools v14 (2.3.0, #345) — the size-line
#     regex now tolerates CIG's S-prefixed form ("Size: S0"), so the four
#     Mining Head lasers, bomb racks, scopes, and the NOVA gatling emit a
#     size in their tags where they previously rendered size-less (e.g.
#     "[Mining Laser]" -> "[Mining Laser-S0]"). Both caches bake rendered
#     tags into their stored names, so both bump or a regen against an
#     unchanged DataForge keeps serving the size-less text.
#   xml_path_index v2 (2.2.0, #231 follow-up) — main() now wraps forge_dir
#     (and everything derived from it, including records_dir) via
#     win_paths.win_long_path before building this index, so its stored path
#     strings carry the \\?\ long-path prefix. xml_path_index had no entry
#     here before, so it silently defaulted to "v1" forever — a pickle built
#     by a pre-#231 run (unprefixed paths, same DataForge fingerprint) was
#     reused indefinitely, mixing unprefixed indexed paths with the now-
#     prefixed bp_dir/entity_dir callers compare them against and crashing
#     scan_crafting_blueprints's xml_file.relative_to(bp_dir) with "not in
#     the subpath of". Bump flushes any pre-#231 pickle.

        Ship components (shield, cooler, powerplant, qdrive, radar) all
        author this trio. Routed through ``render_tag`` so the user's
        component TagConfig (mapping / separator / enclosing / element
        ordering) is honoured. A defensive non-render_tag path preserves
        the legacy ``[CLASS-Sx-grade]`` output bit-for-bit when
        ``tag_builder`` isn't importable.

      Fallback — Size: present + at least one of {recognised Item Type,
      Grade A-D}. Class: is optional and the size may be written either
      as bare "N" or as the mining-style "SN" (S0, S00). Output shape:

        [Sx-grade]       (Grade present but Item Type not in the abbreviation map)
      The fallback path skips ``render_tag`` — these items aren't the
      user-customisable ship-component case Tag Builder targets, and the
      partial output shapes don't align with the element-ordered render
      pipeline.

    Requiring at least one of {type_abbrev, grade_m} on the fallback path
    keeps a bare ``[Sx]`` from leaking onto anything that happens to have
    a Size: line (consumables, ammo containers, etc.) — the tag has to
    convey something beyond the size that's usually implied by the
    entity's own name anyway.

    Returns ``None`` when Size: itself is missing OR when the fallback's

    Covers Arbor, Lancet, Helix, Hofstede, Klein, Impact (under

    already author the headline numbers (Mining Laser Power, Optimal /
    Maximum Range, Module Slots, Resistance / Instability modifiers),
    so this function focuses on stats that DON'T appear in the
    description today: component HP, damage resistances, fire-beam
    energy draw + heat + wear, distortion threshold, and the per-mode
    damage-per-second values from the fire actions.

    The mining-laser modifier block (``SEntityComponentMiningLaserParams``)
    holds the laserInstability / chargeWindow / resistance / filter
    modifier values. Those duplicate what CIG already prints, but the
    user-confirmed convention for this gear category is "append always
    — CIG sometimes forgets to update the description after a balance
    pass", so they're emitted here too.

    Mining lasers that reference a globalParams record by UUID for
    their BASE values (mining-laser power range, optimal range, etc.)
    don't have those base values resolved here in v1 — local extraction
    only. That's a v2 enhancement; for now CIG's description is the
    source of truth for the base values and this function adds the
    overlay-style stats the user can't see elsewhere.

    expected to match the components Tag Builder's placement so the
    POTENTIAL BLUEPRINTS list stays visually consistent with the
    component names on the strings tab. Tier-2 / tier-3 fallbacks
    intentionally skip the tag: the tag dict is keyed by entityClass
    UUID, which is exactly the linkage that's missing in those code
    paths, so there's nothing to look up. FPS gear / weapons / ships
    never get a tag entry, so they pass through bare even on a UUID hit.

        entity_name_tags: UUID → ``[CLASS-Sx-grade]`` tag. Optional —
            without it items render without the inline component tag.
        name_tag_placement: "prepend" (tag before the name, the
            default) or "append" (tag after). Mirrors the components

    The two element types serve different blueprint slots:

    * ``CraftingCost_Resource`` points at an abstract resource-type UUID
      (e.g. the "agricium" resource pool); it appears INSIDE every

      ``__ref`` UUID (the entity-class UUID). The EMITTER and APERTURE
      IRIS slots on the Omnisky III, for example, reference

    * entity_names_by_filename: XML filename stem → display name
      — same name as above but indexed by the XML filename instead of

      entityClass UUID that doesn't __ref any entity record (CIG WIP
      pattern in PTU patches — blueprints land before the entity UUID
      assignments are finalised). The blueprint's own filename minus
      its `bp_craft_` / `bp_rewards_` prefix matches the entity XML's
      filename in CIG's authored layout.
    * entity_name_tags: __ref UUID → ``[CLASS-Sx-grade]`` tag (e.g.
      ``[MIL-S1-A]``) when the entity is a ship component whose
      description carries the Size:/Grade:/Class: header trio, plus

      gear, missiles, ammo) still gets no entry. Used by blueprint pool

      that the components/ship-weapon pipelines apply to stock item
      titles, so a mission's "POTENTIAL BLUEPRINTS" list reads e.g.
      "Norfield [MIL-S1-A]" or "Norfield [Fuel Nozzle]" instead of bare
      "Norfield" -- without this, the tag only ever appeared on the
      item's own name, never inside the mission text a player actually
      reads.

        the reputation TRACK that rank belongs to (e.g. "Security",
        "Contractor", "Bounty Hunting") — two derived views of the same
        displayName attribute. Used to be two separate _cached_lookup jobs
        that each walked and parsed every standings XML on their own; same
        UUID/displayName pair read twice per cache build for no reason, and
        two independent dicts built from the same source risked drifting
        apart. Mirrors _build_scitem_pair below for the same "one XML walk,
        several derived dicts" shape.

        Some factions have multiple reputation tracks (Foxwell Enforcement
        shows separate "Security" and "Standing" columns in-game); which
        track a mission feeds isn't obvious from its type or name alone (a
        ship-combat "Security Patrol" contract actually feeds the generic
        Contractor/Standing track, while the satellite-scan "Destroy Data
        Skimmers" contract feeds Security) — see issue #161.

        Every standing rank's ``displayName`` loc key encodes its track as
        the token right after the ``RepStanding_``/``RepScope_`` prefix
        (``RepStanding_Security_Rank0``, ``RepScope_Contractor_Rank3``);
        that token's ``RepScope_<track>_Name`` key gives the clean label
        already used by the in-game Reputation Manager UI.
